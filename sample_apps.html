		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<p>
			This section will guide you through the necessary tools you will need for compiling the sample apps (which will come as part of the PayPalHere SDK release) and step by step process of compiling the sample apps.<br><br>

			As part of the release, you will get two different sample apps along with source code.<br>
			<ul>
				<li><b>PayPalHereSampleApp: </b> This application showcases the functionality of<br>
					<p></p>

			</ul>
		</p>

		<h2>Necessary Tools</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Android Studio (1.0.1 or higher)</li>
			<li>Maven (3.1.1 or higher)</li>
			<li>Latest Android SDK</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Steps to be followed before compiling the sample app</h3>
		<p>Android Gradle build system doesn't allow referencing the .aar files locally by keeping them in libs folder. Instead they have to be referenced as remote or local maven artifacts. For that first we will install the PayPalHereSDK-X.X.aar file in local Maven repositories and reference it as local maven artifact.

			<br><br>
			
			Command for installing PayPalHereSDK-X.X.aar as local maven artifact<br><br>

			mvn install:install-file -Dfile=[location where the PayPalHereSDK.aar files exists ex. sdk/PayPalHereSDK-X.X.aar] -DgroupId=com.paypal.merchant.sdk -DartifactId=paypal-sdk -Dversion=X.X -Dpackaging=aar
			
			<br><br>

			Note: Please replace X.X with the version of the release. You can find the version in the name of the release library. Ex: PayPalHereSDK-X.X.aar where X.X represents the release version.
